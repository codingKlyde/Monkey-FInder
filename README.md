### About This Project

This project is a .NET MAUI application that displays a list of monkeys from around the world. It was created as part of a learning experience by following the [dotnet-maui-workshop](https://github.com/dotnet-presentations/dotnet-maui-workshop). While building this application, I experimented with different features and made some changes to explore and learn new things.

Feel free to use this project as a reference or for any other purpose you find useful. It's a learning tool, and I hope it helps you in your .NET MAUI journey as well.
